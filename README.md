Components needed

1. Arduino UNO
2. AD8232 ECG Sensor Module
3. Leads that can be placed on body
4. Breadboard
5. Jumper wires

Assemble all these as per the picture of the circuit diagram given in the repo. Also add all the libraries mentioned in the code and you're ready with your own Arduino Based ECG heartrate monitor. Cheers ! @ThePJcodes
